2. Create a Spotify app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications/.
3. Add a `Redirect URI` in the settings of the app (say, https://google.com).
4. Start a terminal session and export a few environment variables (with `export` command in `bash`).
5. Add `CLIENT_ID`,`CLIENT_SECRET` (hush; it's a secret 😉) and `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI`.
